    <h1>About Oasis</h1>
    <p>Rooted in integrity. Designed for peace.</p>

    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>Oasis Landscape and Excavation began with a simple idea: to create peaceful, lasting spaces where people feel at home in nature. Founded in Montana and built on a foundation of hard work, trust, and craftsmanship, Oasis is more than a landscaping company — it’s a team of builders, designers, and stewards of the land.</p>
    <p>Over the years, we've grown by staying grounded in our values: honesty, quality, and service. Today, we specialize in high-end landscape transformations that balance functionality with serenity — whether that means installing precision irrigation systems, designing stonework and outdoor features, or finalizing lush, living finishes.</p>

    <h2>Community & Volunteer Work</h2>
    <p>Oasis has proudly contributed time, equipment, and labor to help communities rebuild after natural disasters. Over the years, our team has responded to some of the most devastating hurricanes to hit the Gulf Coast — including Hurricanes Ivan, Katrina, Laura, and Sally.</p>
    <p>From emergency tree removal to clearing access for recovery crews, we’ve answered the call when people needed it most. This spirit of service continues to shape who we are and why we build with care and purpose.</p>

    <h2>Core Values</h2>

    <h3>For Our Customers</h3>
    <p><strong>Serving the Customer:</strong> We exist to serve. Every job starts and ends with the client’s best interest in mind. We strive to exceed expectations and earn trust with every project.</p>
    <p><strong>Protecting Your Oasis (Privacy & Discretion):</strong> What’s yours stays yours. We safeguard your privacy and do not share photos, videos, or details of your project without explicit permission—except in legal matters or authorized marketing use.</p>
    <p><strong>Integrity in Every Interaction:</strong> We do what’s right—even when no one’s watching. Our word means something, and we stand behind our work with transparency and accountability.</p>
    <p><strong>Clear Communication:</strong> We speak plainly and professionally. We eliminate confusion by setting clear expectations, addressing concerns head-on, and being honest—every step of the way.</p>
    <p><strong>Respect for Property and People:</strong> Every space we enter is sacred. We work clean, stay courteous, and treat your home, family, and neighborhood with the respect they deserve.</p>
    <p><strong>Excellence in Craftsmanship:</strong> We don’t cut corners—unless it’s part of the design. From foundations to finish work, we commit to long-lasting quality that you can be proud of.</p>
    <p><strong>Financial Responsibility and Debt-Free Values:</strong> We build on solid ground—financially and physically. We operate debt-free to ensure financial strength and service stability for our customers, avoiding shortcuts or pressure caused by overextension.</p>

    <h3>For Our Team</h3>
    <p><strong>No Gossip:</strong> We don’t talk about people—only to them. Gossip weakens teams. We solve problems directly and professionally, with honesty and respect.</p>
    <p><strong>Unity and Loyalty:</strong> We’re in this together. We support the mission, the team, and each other. No cliques, no backstabbing—just shared purpose and accountability.</p>
    <p><strong>Accountability and Ownership:</strong> We own it—from start to finish. No finger-pointing. Everyone is responsible for their work, their words, and the results.</p>
    <p><strong>Safety is Non-Negotiable:</strong> We protect life above all else. From jobsite protocols to mental health, safety is the standard—not the exception.</p>
    <p><strong>Continuous Growth:</strong> We get better every day. We stay humble, stay teachable, and improve our skills, systems, and standards constantly.</p>
    <p><strong>Stewardship of Resources:</strong> We treat tools, time, and materials like they’re our own. We minimize waste, maximize value, and build with care and precision.</p>
    <p><strong>Passion and Purpose:</strong> We believe in what we build. We’re not just moving dirt or planting shrubs—we’re building legacies. Every project matters, and so does every teammate.</p>
